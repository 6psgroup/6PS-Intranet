# 6PS Corporation - Intranet Platform

<em><strong>DEPRECATION WARNING:</strong></em> This project is no longer used in production
and may be deprecated or out of date.

Intranet platform developed internally by 6PS Corporation. This was developed as an internal
system for asset management, financial management, and encrypted password storage. Some of
the features were never completed, but we are posting this up as-is in case there is any
relevant functionality that might be useful. We may use this in the future, but currently
it is dormant.

This code was resurrected from an old code repo. Unforunately, the database schema has been
lost. That said, the schema was pretty simple and you should be able to look at the queries
that are, <em>unforunately<em>, in the controllers and reconstruct it. There were only a few
tables relative to each feature. Sorry!

Fork away!
